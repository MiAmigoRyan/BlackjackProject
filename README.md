# BlackjackProject
This program needs to be compiled
and run through an IDE that supports Java 8.
# Overview
The program Black Jack reads is a functioning simulation of
the popular card game Black Jack. The goal of this project was primarily to apply classes in an Object Oriented manner. The program 
uses classes who'd fields are Objects ("has-a").
Many methods are used for the program and some collections were 
implemented to organize that data. Conditionals are also used in
this game's logic

# Lessons Learned

This project built significantly off of what I have learned about OOP.
I found the most difficult aspect of this project was understanding
how and when to call various objects and struggled at times stepping
into classes. Looking back, spending more time in the design step
would have saved me time and headache. On other projects I built out
methods as I went (comments - define methods - logic - test). In this project I 
decided to try to build the logic of the game first and then move to methods.
(comments - logic - test - define methods). This approach turned out to take
more time and lead to more issues. I am glad that I attempted to do it this way
however, will likely not be approaching writing code this way again.
This project also further solidified my understanding and ability to apply
A P I E principles.
